title: "Docker Run"
---
WIP

In this section, we will review the `docker run` command. The `docker run` command enables us to spin an image into a container. Let's use the `run` command to launch the `r-base` image we pulled in the previous section inside a container:

``` shell
docker run rocker/r-base
```

This will results in the below warning and error:

``` shell
WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested
Fatal error: you must specify '--save', '--no-save' or '--vanilla'
```
The main reason for getting this error is releated to the execution type of the container which is not aligned with CMD command. To solve this issue we will run the container in an interactive mode using the `--interactive --tty` arguments:

```shell
docker run --interactive --tty rocker/r-base
```

This will open R session inside a container:

```shell
WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested
