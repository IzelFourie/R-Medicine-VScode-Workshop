It is a user-friendly container management interface that is compatible with MacOS, Windows, and Linux operating systems.\nNote: Docker Desktop is free for personal use but requires a license for commercial use. For further information, please refer to https://www.docker.com/pricing/.\nTo install Docker Desktop, go to Docker website and follow the installation instructions according to your OS:\n\n\n\nFigure 1 - Docker Desktop download page",

There are many container registries, and the most common is Docker Hub. We will use throughout the tutorial Docker Hub to pull different images, such as Python built-in images. To register and create an account go to https://hub.docker.com and follow the registration instructions.\nAfter installing Docker Desktop and setting account on Docker Hub, open Docker Desktop, and from the command line, login to Docker Hub:\n docker login\nYou will have to enter your username and password, and you should expect the following output if the login is successful:\nLogin with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one.\nUsername: rkrispin\nPassword:\nLogin Succeeded\n\nLogging in with your password grants your terminal complete access to your account.\nFor better security, log in with a limited-privilege personal access token. Learn more at https://docs.docker.com/go/access-tokens/\nNote: Docker Hub is completely public (for the free tier). Any image you push and store there will be available for all other users. Regardless if your container registry is public or not, NEVER store credentials, passwords, or any other sensitive information on your Docker images.\n\nHello World!\nThere is no better way to test if Docker was installed properly than by running whalesay (or üê≥ say) Docker‚Äôs most Hello World! common example.

You can see the search results below, and clicking on each extension will open a window with the extension details. - Last but not least, Click the install button (see the green rectangular) to install the extension\n\n\n\nFigure 3 - Steps to install extension on VScode\n\n\n\nNote: The Dev Containers extension is required to launch the dockerized environment. We will see later in this tutorial how to set and install the necessary extensions for your dockerized environment automatically with the devcontainer.json file.",
